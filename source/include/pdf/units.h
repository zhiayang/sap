/*
    72 units is 1 inch, 1 inch is 25.4mm. we don't want to assume
    the base unit (which we can change to be eg. Âµm or something).

    We define two separate units/coordinate systems -- the typographic_unit is the normal PDF unit and
    coordinate system, running at 72dpi with Y+ going UPWARDS. We also define typographic_unit_y_down,
    which is also 72dpi, but Y+ goes DOWNWARDS.

    Later on (below), we delete the conversion functions between these systems, because we need the page
    size to convert between them, so it's not as simple as just a `into()`. At the PDF interface,
    all systems require the normal `typographic_unit`.

    However, we can't delete every combination (due to C++ limitations), so care must still be taken to
    convert between the y-up and y-down coordinate systems at the sap-pdf interface.
