# the problem rn is that we don't properly support expr calls, and function
# callees are really only "supposed" to be identifiers that we manually overload-resolve
#
# we fixed convert_params so that it correctly handles variables (not functions)
# and extracts the expected parameter types, however the cst::FunctionCall expects a
# Declaration as the callee; obviously, it also needs to take an expression
#
# probably have Either<Declaration, Expr>; for the Expr we expect the evaluated result
# to be a Value::function, which we can then call normally.
#
# not sure if this is short-sighted for when we get bytecode compilation, but whatever
