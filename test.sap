pains/things to fix:

[ ] numbered_lists can't be more than 9 things long, otherwise the numbers don't line up

[ ] dereferencing optionals might need to clone them (which is weird)

[ ] prettier std::qty

[ ] no way to get value out of enum instance

[ ] sap crash:
	fn foo(f: builtin::Style) { builtin::apply_style(f, builtin::make_text("A")); }
	foo({line_spacing:1em});

NUS currently has a gap in its operating systems courses, between the introductory CS2106
and the advanced, graduate-level CS5250. In this project, we significantly overhaul an
educational OS, Stanford's Pintos, to make it more suitable for use in NUS. We
rewrite the OS in modern \cpp()20 and greatly improve upon it in all aspects, including
functionality, design, and readability. We also propose and develop several lab projects
and extension avenues for a future CS3xxx module that will sit between CS2106 and CS5250.
